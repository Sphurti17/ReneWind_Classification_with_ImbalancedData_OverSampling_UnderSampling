# ReneWind_Classification_with_ImbalancedData_OverSampling_UnderSampling

Objective:
● ReneWind is a company working on improving the machinery/processes involved in the production of
wind energy using machine learning and has collected data of generator failure of wind turbines using
sensors.
● The objective is to build various classification models, tune them, and find the best one that will help
identify failures so that the generators could be repaired before failing/breaking to reduce the overall
maintenance cost.
